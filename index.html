        <p><em>Aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong></em></p>
        <p> The only time, I can stay put in a place for several hours is when I am coding.
          When I first saw a computer back in 2006, I didn't know how to turn it on. And when my computer teacher pushed a button on the BIG BOX(CPU), and when the black CRT monitor suddenly turned into blue. I had such an amazing feeling going on
          inside
          my brain, that I might have blacked out for some seconds. Then, I remember my teacher saying some alien words(Mouse, Keyboard, and so onüòÜ).
          Now, that alien is my best bud and I can't keep track of time when I am solving some crazy interesting coding problems. Every day I am learning new skills, new ideas, and the amount of knowledge that humans have discovered and researched
          never
          fails to amaze me. There is so much more to learn.
          I am a Computer Science undergraduate student currently in the final year. As of now, I have good knowledge of Python, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. And I am learning more every day. This world is so big and beautiful and I
          want to
          be a part of an amazing team, from where I can contribute to make this planet a better place.</p>
